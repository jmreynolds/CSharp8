# Abstract

Visual Studio released in the summer of 2015, and with it came C# 6. 
Joe will be reviewing some of the new language features. In addition, 
you will get to see how those features work, not just in the latest 
version of .Net (4.6), but in prior versions. Finally, Joe will try 
to help you determine which features you should focus on adopting 
immediately, and which ones you can gradually adopt, 
as the need arises.
