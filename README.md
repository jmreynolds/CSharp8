# Abstract

Visual Studio 2019 is out! Along with Visual Studio, 
.Net Core 3.x is in preview mode, and with that comes C# 8. 
Joe will be reviewing some of the new language features. In addition, 
you will get to see how those features work, not just in the latest 
version of .Net, but in prior versions. Finally, Joe will try 
to help you determine which features you should focus on adopting 
immediately, and which ones you can gradually adopt, 
as the need arises.
